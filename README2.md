# Oculo Code Review
## The Code
Inside of `code.zip` is some code that solves the following problem:
- Allow an API client to create a message from an existing user to an existing user and send it via an external api
- Allow an API client to query the message at a later date to determine if the message has been successfully sent.

It also contains an integration spec that tests the desired behaviour

It's also worth noting this code has been designed to be problematic and is not indicative of how we write code at Oculo

## The Exercise
We would like you to do the following:
- Create a repository called `oculo_code_review`
- Download and extract the contents of `code.zip`
- Create a pull request against your repo with the contents of `code.zip`
- Review the pull request identifying problems you find in the code and suggest changes you would make to improve
the code's maintainability, reliability and extendability

When you're happy with your review send us a link to the PR.
